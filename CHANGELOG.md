# Changelog

## 0.5.0

* Added styles for **Model Preview** extension's Civitai info display.

## 0.4.0

* Improve **Image Browser** styles, align the buttons in the pagination controls toolbar.

## 0.3.0

* Avoid setting CSS variables to every element. Instead, set them only to the `:root` and the `body` for theme

  continuous inheritance overriding that browsers would have to deal with.
* Fix blockquote styling.
* Improvements to **Model Preview** extension's styling, and make the **Copy metadata** button more visible from
  the image.

* Set the Lobe custom logo as the favicon shown in the browser tab.

## 0.1.1

* Re-packaging of 0.1.0. No actual code changes.

## 0.1.0
